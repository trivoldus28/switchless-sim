While interconnection network has been a popular topic in the community for a long time\cite{datacenter3}, only few recent literatures introduce network architectures that are suited for data center usage. Representative literature suggests some specific data center network architectures or topologies such as fat-tree \cite{Al-Fares:2008:SCD, datacenter4}, DCell\cite{datacenter2}, and BCube\cite{datacenter5}. 
Fat-tree suffers from high-cost problem because it requires large, high-performance switch. BCube and DCell uses fewer switches 


(1) Some citations on datacenter network architecture research
(2) Point out that they focused on performance improvement rather than cost -- we rather focus on cost/performance -- cost is ipmortant in data center
(3) Cite BCube as a special case on server-centric datacenter network architecture  -- still uses a switch / include brief cost analysis if possible

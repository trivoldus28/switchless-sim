\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}
(1) Some citations on datacenter network architecture research
(2) Point out that they focused on performance improvement rather than cost -- we rather focus on cost/performance -- cost is ipmortant in data center
(3) Cite BCube as a special case on server-centric datacenter network architecture  -- still uses a switch / include brief cost analysis if possible

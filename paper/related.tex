While interconnection network has been a popular topic in the community for a long time\cite{datacenter3}, only few recent literatures introduce network architectures that are suited for data center usage. Representative literature suggests some specific data center network architectures or topologies such as fat-tree \cite{Al-Fares:2008:SCD, datacenter4}, DCell\cite{datacenter2}, and BCube\cite{datacenter5}. 

Fat-tree suffers from high-cost problem because it requires large, high-performance switches and expensive fiber optic inter-switch links. BCube and DCell uses fewer switches and inter-switch links but still has the high cost. While those previously proposed data center network architectures are soley focusing on performance optimization, our data center network architecture focuses on both performance and cost per performance. In addition, our switchless network architecture also offers other qualitative benefits mentioned in earlier part of this paper.

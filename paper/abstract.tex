\begin{abstract}
The network architecture is an important portion of the data center architecture in both performance and cost aspects. While conventional architectures are heavily focused on maximizing its performance, it often incurs large economic cost. In this paper, we propose an economical alternative of the data center network architecture. Our proposed switchless architecture shows a comparable performance at significantly lower cost.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, we proposed an economic alternative of the conventional data center network architecture : switchless network architecture. Our analysis and evaluation show that our switchless network architecture can deliver comparable performance at a much lower cost thereby having much better cost per performance.

A data center network architecture can have a huge impact on both performance and cost of a data center. While conventional hierarchical or fat-tree style network architecture provide competitive performance, it has several drawbacks : cost, robustness, and limited performance on certain set of applications. 

In this paper, we introduce an economical alternative to conventional hiherachical network architecture: switchless network architecture. Conventional hierarchical network architecture often has a high cost mainly because it utilizes many large, high-performance switches. To avoid the high cost of large, high-performance switches, our proposed switchless architecture uses mesh/cube style network topology instead of tree-style topology. In addition, instead of using smaller switches, we propose to use cheap on-board ICs to perform the function of simple switches to (1) enhance performance of the system and (2) further reduce cost of the system. Moreover, we also propose the use of dimension ordered routing to further enhance system's performance.

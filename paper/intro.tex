A data center network architecture can have a huge impact on both the performance and cost of a data center. While conventional hierarchical or fat-tree style network architecture provide competitive performance, it has several drawbacks: cost, robustness, and limited performance on certain set of applications. 

In this paper, we introduce an economical alternative to conventional hierarchical network architecture: the switchless network architecture. Conventional hierarchical network architectures often have a high cost mainly because they utilize many large, high-performance switches and high-cost long-distance fiber optic inter-switch links. To avoid the high cost of large, high-performance switches and long fiber optic links, our proposed switchless architecture uses mesh/cube style network topology instead of tree-style topology. In addition, we propose integrating switching functionality into the server to (1) enhance performance of the system and (2) further reduce cost of the system. Moreover, we also propose the use of dimension ordered routing to further enhance system performance.
